 abstract = {Traditional testing procedures typically utilize unidimensional item response theory (IRT) models to provide a single, continuous estimate of a student's overall ability. Advances in psychometrics have focused on measuring multiple dimensions of ability to provide more detailed feedback for students, teachers, and other stakeholders. Diagnostic classification models (DCMs) provide multidimensional feedback by using categorical latent variables that represent distinct skills underlying a test that students may or may not have mastered. The Scaling Individuals and Classifying Misconceptions (SICM) model is presented as a combination of a unidimensional IRT model and a DCM where the categorical latent variables represent misconceptions instead of skills. In addition to an estimate of ability along a latent continuum, the SICM model provides multidimensional, diagnostic feedback in the form of statistical estimates of probabilities that students have certain misconceptions. Through an empirical data analysis, we show how this additional feedback can be used by stakeholders to tailor instruction for students' needs. We also provide results from a simulation study that demonstrate that the SICM MCMC estimation algorithm yields reasonably accurate estimates under large-scale testing conditions.},

 abstract = {Q-matrix validation is of increasing concern due to the significance and subjective tendency of Q-matrix construction in the modeling process. This research proposes a residual-based approach to empirically validate Q-matrix specification based on a combination of fit measures. The approach separates Q-matrix validation into four logical steps, including the test-level evaluation, possible distinction between attribute-level and item-level misspecifications, identification of the hit item, and fit information to aid in item adjustment. Through simulation studies and real-life examples, it is shown that the misspecified items can be detected as the hit item and adjusted sequentially when the misspecification occurs at the item level or at random. Adjustment can be based on the maximum reduction of the test-level measures. When adjustment of individual items tends to be useless, attribute-level misspecification is of concern. The approach can accommodate a variety of cognitive diagnosis models (CDMs) and be extended to cover other response formats.},

 abstract = {Latent class models are powerful tools in psychological and educational measurement. These models classify individuals into subgroups based on a set of manifest variables, assisting decision making in a diagnostic system. In this article, based on information theory, the authors propose a mutual information reliability (MIR) coefficient that summaries the measurement quality of latent class models, where the latent variables being measured are categorical. The proposed coefficient is analogous to a version of reliability coefficient for item response theory models and meets the general concept of measurement reliability in the Standards for Educational and Psychological Testing. The proposed coefficient can also be viewed as an extension of the McFadden's pseudo R-square coefficient, which evaluates the goodness-of-fit of logistic regression model, to latent class models. Thanks to several information-theoretic inequalities, the MIR coefficient is unitless, lies between 0 and 1, and receives good interpretation from a measurement point of view. The coefficient can be applied to both fixed and computerized adaptive testing designs. The performance of the MIR coefficient is demonstrated by simulated examples.},

Cognitive diagnosis models (CDMs) are ideal for tracking many fine-grained skills that comprise a domain, and can assist in carefully navigating through the training and assessment of these skills in e-learning applications. A class of CDMs for modeling changes in attributes is proposed, which is referred to as learning trajectories.

 abstract = {Cognitive diagnostic models (CDMs) are latent variable models developed to infer latent skills, knowledge, or personalities that underlie responses to educational, psychological, and social science tests and measures. Recent research focused on theory and methods for using sparse latent class models (SLCMs) in an exploratory fashion to infer the latent processes and structure underlying responses. We report new theoretical results about sufficient conditions for generic identifiability of SLCM parameters. An important contribution for practice is that our new generic identifiability conditions are more likely to be satisfied in empirical applications than existing conditions that ensure strict identifiability. Learning the underlying latent structure can be formulated as a variable selection problem. We develop a new Bayesian variable selection algorithm that explicitly enforces generic identifiability conditions and monotonicity of item response functions to ensure valid posterior inference. We present Monte Carlo simulation results to support accurate inferences and discuss the implications of our findings for future SLCM research and educational testing.},

 abstract = {Although considerable developments have been added to the cognitive diagnosis modeling literature recently, most have been conducted for dichotomous responses only. This research proposes a general cognitive diagnosis model for polytomous responses-the general polytomous diagnosis model (GPDM), which combines the G-DINA modeling process for dichotomous responses with the item-splitting process for polytomous responses. The polytomous items are specified similar to dichotomous items in the Q-matrix, and the MML estimation is implemented using an EM algorithm. Under the general framework, different saturated forms, and some reduced forms, can be transformed linearly. Model assessment and adjustment under the dichotomous context can be extended to polytomous responses. This simulation study demonstrates the effectiveness of the model when comparing the two response types. The real-data example further illustrates how the proposed model can make a difference in practice.},

 abstract = {Diagnostic classification models are confirmatory in the sense that the relationship between the latent attributes and responses to items is specified or parameterized. Such models are readily interpretable with each component of the model usually having a practical meaning. However, parameterized diagnostic classification models are sometimes too simple to capture all the data patterns, resulting in significant model lack of fit. In this paper, we attempt to obtain a compromise between interpretability and goodness of fit by regularizing a latent class model. Our approach starts with minimal assumptions on the data structure, followed by suitable regularization to reduce complexity, so that readily interpretable, yet flexible model is obtained. An expectation-maximization-type algorithm is developed for efficient computation. It is shown that the proposed approach enjoys good theoretical properties. Results from simulation studies and a real application are presented.},

Specifically, the investigations of M2 for specific DCMs rather than general modeling frameworks are needed. This article aims to demonstrate the usefulness of M2 in hierarchical diagnostic classification models (HDCMs). The performance of M2 in evaluating the fit of HDCMs was investigated in the presence of four types of attribute hierarchies. Two simulation studies were conducted to examine Type I error rates and statistical power of M2 under different simulation conditions, respectively. The findings suggest acceptable Type I error rates control of M2 as well as high statistical power under the conditions of a Q-matrix misspecification and the DINA model misspecification.

 abstract = {The focus of cognitive diagnosis (CD) is on evaluating an examinee's strengths and weaknesses in terms of cognitive skills learned and skills that need study. Current methods for fitting CD models (CDMs) work well for large-scale assessments, where the data of hundreds or thousands of examinees are available. However, the development of CD-based assessment tools that can be used in small-scale test settings, say, for monitoring the instruction and learning process at the classroom level has not kept up with the rapid pace at which research and development proceeded for large-scale assessments. The main reason is that the sample sizes of the small-scale test settings are simply too small to guarantee the reliable estimation of item parameters and examinees' proficiency class membership. In this article, a general nonparametric classification (GNPC) method that allows for assigning examinees to the correct proficiency classes with a high rate when sample sizes are at the classroom level is proposed as an extension of the nonparametric classification (NPC) method (Chiu and Douglas in J Classif 30:225-250, 2013). The proposed method remedies the shortcomings of the NPC method and can accommodate any CDM. The theoretical justification and the empirical studies are presented based on the saturated general CDMs, supporting the legitimacy of using the GNPC method with any CDM. The results from the simulation studies and real data analysis show that the GNPC method outperforms the general CDMs when samples are small.},

 abstract = {Diagnostic models (DMs) provide researchers and practitioners with tools to classify respondents into substantively relevant classes. DMs are widely applied to binary response data; however, binary response models are not applicable to the wealth of ordinal data collected by educational, psychological, and behavioral researchers. Prior research developed confirmatory ordinal DMs that require expert knowledge to specify the underlying structure. This paper introduces an exploratory DM for ordinal data. In particular, we present an exploratory ordinal DM, which uses a cumulative probit link along with Bayesian variable selection techniques to uncover the latent structure. Furthermore, we discuss new identifiability conditions for structured multinomial mixture models with binary attributes. We provide evidence of accurate parameter recovery in a Monte Carlo simulation study across moderate to large sample sizes. We apply the model to twelve items from the public-use, Early Childhood Longitudinal Study, Kindergarten Class of 1998-1999 approaches to learning and self-description questionnaire and report evidence to support a three-attribute solution with eight classes to describe the latent structure underlying the teacher and parent ratings. In short, the developed methodology contributes to the development of ordinal DMs and broadens their applicability to address theoretical and substantive issues more generally across the social sciences.},

 abstract = {The deterministic inputs, noisy, {\textquotedbl}and{\textquotedbl} gate (DINA) model is a popular cognitive diagnosis model (CDM) in psychology and psychometrics used to identify test takers' profiles with respect to a set of latent attributes or skills. In this work, we propose an estimation method for the DINA model with the No-U-Turn Sampler (NUTS) algorithm, an extension to Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) method. We conduct a simulation study in order to evaluate the parameter recovery and efficiency of this new Markov chain Monte Carlo method and to compare it with two other Bayesian methods, the Metropolis Hastings and Gibbs sampling algorithms, and with a frequentist method, using the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm. The results indicated that NUTS algorithm employed in the DINA model properly recovers all parameters and is accurate for all simulated scenarios. We apply this methodology in the mental health area in order to develop a new method of classification for respondents to the Beck Depression Inventory. The implementation of this method for the DINA model applied to other psychological tests has the potential to improve the medical diagnostic process.},

@article{delaTorreChiu.2016,
 abstract = {In contrast to unidimensional item response models that postulate a single underlying proficiency, cognitive diagnosis models (CDMs) posit multiple, discrete skills or attributes, thus allowing CDMs to provide a finer-grained assessment of examinees' test performance. A common component of CDMs for specifying the attributes required for each item is the Q-matrix. Although construction of Q-matrix is typically performed by domain experts, it nonetheless, to a large extent, remains a subjective process, and misspecifications in the Q-matrix, if left unchecked, can have important practical implications. To address this concern, this paper proposes a discrimination index that can be used with a wide class of CDM subsumed by the generalized deterministic input, noisy {\textquotedbl}and{\textquotedbl} gate model to empirically validate the Q-matrix specifications by identifying and replacing misspecified entries in the Q-matrix. The rationale for using the index as the basis for a proposed validation method is provided in the form of mathematical proofs to several relevant lemmas and a theorem. The feasibility of the proposed method was examined using simulated data generated under various conditions. The proposed method is illustrated using fraction subtraction data.},

@article{DiBelloHensonStout.2015b,
 abstract = {This article proposes a new family of diagnostic classification models (DCM) called the Generalized Diagnostic Classification Models for Multiple Choice Option-Based Scoring (GDCM-MC). The GDCM-MC is created for multiple choice assessments with response options designed to attract particular kinds of student thinking and understanding, both desired (correct) thinking and problematic (incorrect or partially correct) thinking. Key features that combine to distinguish GDCM-MC are: (a) an expanded latent space that can include both desirable and problematic facets of thinking, (b) an expanded Q matrix that includes a row for each response option and that uses a three-valued coding scheme to specify which latent states are strongly attracted to that option, (c) a guessing component that responds to the forced choice aspect of multiple choice questions, and (d) a general modeling framework that can incorporate the diagnostic modeling functionality of almost any dichotomous DCM, such as deterministic input, noisy ``and'' gate (DINA), reparameterized unified model (RUM), loglinear cognitive diagnosis model (LCDM), or general diagnostic model (GDM). The article discusses these four components and presents the GDCM-MC model equation as a mixture of cognitive and guessing components. Two identifiability theorems are presented. A Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) model estimation algorithm is discussed, and real and simulated data studies are reported.},

The results are developed at a high level of generality and are applicable to essentially all diagnostic classification models. In particular, we establish identifiability results for various modeling parameters, notably item response probabilities, attribute distribution, and Q-matrix-induced partial information structure. These results are stated under a general setting of latent class models. Through a nonparametric Bayes approach, we construct an estimator that can be shown to be consistent when the identifiability conditions are satisfied. Simulation results show that these estimators perform well under various model settings. We also apply the proposed method to a dataset from the National Epidemiological Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions (NESARC).},

The efficiency of the new methods is compared with the posterior-weighted Kullback-Leibler (PWKL) item selection index using a simulation study in the context of the G-DINA model. The impact of item quality, generating models, and test termination rules on attribute classification accuracy or test length is also investigated. The results of the study show that the MPWKL and GDI perform very similarly, and have higher correct attribute classification rates or shorter mean test lengths compared with the PWKL. In addition, the GDI has the shortest implementation time among the three indices. The proportion of item usage with respect to the required attributes across the different conditions is also tracked and discussed.},

 abstract = {The Q-matrix of a cognitively diagnostic test is said to be complete if it allows for the identification of all possible proficiency classes among examinees. Completeness of the Q-matrix is therefore a key requirement for any cognitively diagnostic test. However, completeness of the Q-matrix is often difficult to establish, especially, for tests with a large number of items involving multiple attributes. As an additional complication, completeness is not an intrinsic property of the Q-matrix, but can only be assessed in reference to a specific cognitive diagnosis model (CDM) supposed to underly the data-that is, the Q-matrix of a given test can be complete for one model but incomplete for another. In this article, a method is presented for assessing whether a given Q-matrix is complete for a given CDM. The proposed procedure relies on the theoretical framework of general CDMs and is therefore legitimate for CDMs that can be reparameterized as a general CDM.},

We first applied the proposed models to an operational dataset and compared their performance to an epitome of current polytomous DCMs in which the ordered data structure is ignored. Findings suggest that the much more parsimonious models that we proposed performed similarly to the current polytomous DCMs and offered useful item-level information in addition to option-level information. We then performed a small simulation study using the applied study condition and demonstrated that the proposed models can provide unbiased parameter estimates and correctly classify individuals. In practice, the proposed models can accommodate much smaller sample sizes than current polytomous DCMs and thus prove useful in many small-scale testing scenarios.},

The flexibility of the T-matrix allows the construction of a natural criterion function as well as a computationally amenable algorithm. Simulations results are presented to demonstrate usefulness and applicability of the proposed method. Extension to handling of the Q-matrix with partial information is presented.

 abstract = {Constructed-response items have been shown to be appropriate for cognitively diagnostic assessments because students' problem-solving procedures can be observed, providing direct evidence for making inferences about their proficiency. However, multiple strategies used by students make item scoring and psychometric analyses challenging. This study introduces the so-called two-digit scoring scheme into diagnostic assessments to record both students' partial credits and their strategies. This study also proposes a diagnostic tree model (DTM) by integrating the cognitive diagnosis models with the tree model to analyse the items scored using the two-digit rubrics. Both convergent and divergent tree structures are considered to accommodate various scoring rules. The MMLE/EM algorithm is used for item parameter estimation of the DTM, and has been shown to provide good parameter recovery under varied conditions in a simulation study. A set of data from TIMSS 2007 mathematics assessment is analysed to illustrate the use of the two-digit scoring scheme and the DTM.},

In this type of study, the primary objective is to measure growth in examinees, individually and collectively. In an item response theory (IRT) framework, longitudinal IRT models can be used to assess growth in examinee ability over time. In a diagnostic classification model (DCM) framework, assessing growth translates to measuring changes in attribute mastery status over time, thereby providing a categorical, criterion-referenced interpretation of growth. This study introduces the Transition Diagnostic Classification Model (TDCM), which combines latent transition analysis with the log-linear cognitive diagnosis model to provide methodology for analyzing growth in a general DCM framework. Simulation study results indicate that the proposed model is flexible, provides accurate and reliable classifications, and is quite robust to violations to measurement invariance over time. The TDCM is used to analyze pre-test/post-test data from a diagnostic mathematics assessment.},

 abstract = {Selecting the most appropriate cognitive diagnosis model (CDM) for an item is a challenging process. Although general CDMs provide better model-data fit, specific CDMs have more straightforward interpretations, are more stable, and can provide more accurate classifications when used correctly. Recently, the Wald test has been proposed to determine at the item level whether a general CDM can be replaced by specific CDMs without a significant loss in model-data fit. The current study examines the practical consequence of the test by evaluating whether the attribute-vector classification based on CDMs selected by the Wald test is better than that based on general CDMs. Although the Wald test can detect the true underlying model for certain CDMs, it is yet unclear how effective it is at distinguishing among the wider range of CDMs found in the literature. This study investigates the relative similarity of the various CDMs through the use of the newly developed dissimiliarity index, and explores the implications for the Wald test. Simulations show that the Wald test cannot distinguish among additive models due to their inherent similarity, but this does not impede the ability of the test to provide higher correct classification rates than general CDMs, particularly when the sample size is small and items are of low quality. An empirical example is included to demonstrate the viability of the procedure.},

It is critical to validate the Q-matrix empirically because a misspecified Q-matrix could result in erroneous attribute estimation. Most existing Q-matrix validation procedures are developed for dichotomous responses. However, in this paper, we propose a method to empirically detect and correct the misspecifications in the Q-matrix for graded response data based on the sequential generalized deterministic inputs, noisy 'and' gate (G-DINA) model. The proposed Q-matrix validation procedure is implemented in a stepwise manner based on the Wald test and an effect size measure.

 abstract = {Large-scale educational testing data often contain vast amounts of variables associated with information pertaining to test takers, schools, or access to educational resources-information that can help explain relationships between test taker performance and their learning environment. This study examines approaches to incorporate latent and observed explanatory variables as predictors for cognitive diagnostic models (CDMs). Methods to specify and simultaneously estimate observed and latent variables (estimated using item response theory) as predictors affecting attribute mastery were examined. Real-world data analyses were conducted to demonstrate the application using large-scale international testing data. Simulation studies were conducted to examine the recovery and classification for simultaneously estimating multiple latent (using dichotomous and polytomous items as indicators for the latent construct) and observed predictors for varying sample sizes and number of attributes. Results showed stable parameter recovery and consistency in attribute classification. Implications for latent predictors and attribute specifications are discussed.},

 abstract = {The purpose of this study was to thoroughly examine the performance of three information-based fit indices-Akaike's Information Criterion (AIC), Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC), and sample-size-adjusted BIC (SABIC)-using the log-linear cognitive diagnosis model and a set of well-known item response theory (IRT) models. Two simulation studies were conducted to examine the extent to which relative fit indices can identify the generating model under a variety of data conditions and model misspecifications. Generally, indices performed better when item quality was stronger. When the IRT was the generating model, all three indices correctly selected the IRT model for all replications. When the true model was a diagnostic classification model, for all three fit indices, the multidimensional IRT model was incorrectly selected as frequently as 70{\%} of the replications. The results of this study identify situations for researchers where commonly used-and typically well-performing-fit indices may not be appropriate to compare models for selection.},

@article{SorrelAbad.2017,
 abstract = {Research related to the fit evaluation at the item level involving cognitive diagnosis models (CDMs) has been scarce. According to the parsimony principle, balancing goodness of fit against model complexity is necessary. General CDMs require a larger sample size to be estimated reliably, and can lead to worse attribute classification accuracy than the appropriate reduced models when the sample size is small and the item quality is poor, which is typically the case in many empirical applications. The main purpose of this study was to systematically examine the statistical properties of four inferential item-fit statistics: S-X2 , the likelihood ratio (LR) test, the Wald (W) test, and the Lagrange multiplier (LM) test. To evaluate the performance of the statistics, a comprehensive set of factors, namely, sample size, correlational structure, test length, item quality, and generating model, is systematically manipulated using Monte Carlo methods. Results show that the S-X2 statistic has unacceptable power. Type I error and power comparisons favor LR and W tests over the LM test. However, all the statistics are highly affected by the item quality. With a few exceptions, their performance is only acceptable when the item quality is high. In some cases, this effect can be ameliorated by an increase in sample size and test length. This implies that using the above statistics to assess item fit in practical settings when the item quality is low remains a challenge.},

This paper introduces the Hierarchical Diagnostic Classification Model (HDCM), which adapts the Log-linear Cognitive Diagnosis Model to cases where attribute hierarchies are present. The utility of the HDCM is demonstrated through simulation and by an empirical example. Simulation study results show the HDCM is efficiently estimated and can accurately test for the presence of an attribute hierarchy statistically, a feature not possible when using more commonly used DCMs. Empirically, the HDCM is used to test for the presence of a suspected attribute hierarchy in a test of English grammar, confirming the data is more adequately represented by hierarchical attribute structure when compared to a crossed, or nonhierarchical structure.},

Having emanated from educational measurement, several aspects of such models seem well suited to use in psychological assessment and diagnosis. This article presents the development of a new cognitive diagnosis model for use in psychological assessment--the DINO (deterministic input; noisy {\textquotedbl}or{\textquotedbl} gate) model--which, as an illustrative example, is applied to evaluate and diagnose pathological gamblers. As part of this example, a demonstration of the estimates obtained by cognitive diagnosis models is provided. Such estimates include the probability an individual meets each of a set of dichotomous Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (text revision [DSM-IV-TR]; American Psychiatric Association, 2000) criteria, resulting in an estimate of the probability an individual meets the DSM-IV-TR definition for being a pathological gambler. Furthermore, a demonstration of how the hypothesized underlying factors contributing to pathological gambling can be measured with the DINO model is presented, through use of a covariance structure model for the tetrachoric correlation matrix of the dichotomous latent variables representing DSM-IV-TR criteria.},

 abstract = {Probabilistic models with one or more latent variables are designed to report on a corresponding number of skills or cognitive attributes. Multidimensional skill profiles offer additional information beyond what a single test score can provide, if the reported skills can be identified and distinguished reliably. Many recent approaches to skill profile models are limited to dichotomous data and have made use of computationally intensive estimation methods such as Markov chain Monte Carlo, since standard maximum likelihood (ML) estimation techniques were deemed infeasible. This paper presents a general diagnostic model (GDM) that can be estimated with standard ML techniques and applies to polytomous response variables as well as to skills with two or more proficiency levels. The paper uses one member of a larger class of diagnostic models, a compensatory diagnostic model for dichotomous and partial credit data. Many well-known models, such as univariate and multivariate versions of the Rasch model and the two-parameter logistic item response theory model, the generalized partial credit model, as well as a variety of skill profile models, are special cases of this GDM. In addition to an introduction to this model, the paper presents a parameter recovery study using simulated data and an application to real data from the field test for TOEFL Internet-based testing.},

 abstract = {Computerized adaptive testing (CAT) was originally proposed to measure \textgreek{j}, usually a latent trait, with greater precision by sequentially selecting items according to the student's responses to previously administered items. Although the application of CAT is promising for many educational testing programs, most of the current CAT systems were not designed to provide diagnostic information. This article discusses item selection strategies specifically tailored for cognitive diagnostic tests. Our goal is to identify an effective item selection algorithm that not only estimates \textgreek{j} efficiently, but also classifies the student's knowledge status \textgreek{a} accurately. A single-stage item selection method with a dual purpose will be introduced. The main idea is to treat diagnostic criteria as constraints: Using the maximum priority index method to meet these constraints, the CAT system is able to generate cognitive diagnostic feedback in a fairly straightforward fashion. Different priority functions are proposed. Some of them are based on certain information measures, such as Kullback-Leibler information, and others utilize only the information provided by the Q-matrix. An extensive simulation study is conducted, and the results indicate that the information-based method not only yields higher classification rates for cognitive diagnosis, but also achieves more accurate \textgreek{j} estimation. Other constraint controls, such as item exposure rates, are also considered for all the competing methods.},

Although there is a growing body of literature discussing model fit checking methods for DCM, the item-level fit analysis is not adequately discussed in literature. This study intends to take an initiative to fill in this gap. Two approaches are proposed, one stems from classical goodness-of-fit test statistics coupled with the Expectation-Maximization algorithm for model estimation, and the other is the posterior predictive model checking (PPMC) method coupled with the Markov chain Monte Carlo estimation. For both approaches, the chi-square statistic and a power-divergence index are considered, along with Stone's method for considering uncertainty in latent attribute estimation. A simulation study with varying manipulated factors is carried out. Results show that both approaches are promising if Stone's method is imposed, but the classical goodness-of-fit approach has a much higher detection rate (i.e., proportion of misfit items that are correctly detected) than the PPMC method.},

 abstract = {There has recently been much interest in computerized adaptive testing (CAT) for cognitive diagnosis. While there exist various item selection criteria and different asymptotically optimal designs, these are mostly constructed based on the asymptotic theory assuming the test length goes to infinity. In practice, with limited test lengths, the desired asymptotic optimality may not always apply, and there are few studies in the literature concerning the optimal design of finite items. Related questions, such as how many items we need in order to be able to identify the attribute pattern of an examinee and what types of initial items provide the optimal classification results, are still open. This paper aims to answer these questions by providing non-asymptotic theory of the optimal selection of initial items in cognitive diagnostic CAT. In particular, for the optimal design, we provide necessary and sufficient conditions for the Q-matrix structure of the initial items. The theoretical development is suitable for a general family of cognitive diagnostic models. The results not only provide a guideline for the design of optimal item selection procedures, but also may be applied to guide item bank construction.},

In particular, we focus on one basic and popular model, the DINA model. We propose sufficient and necessary conditions under which the model parameters are identifiable from the data. The consequences, in terms of the consistency of parameter estimates, of fulfilling or failing to fulfill these conditions are illustrated via simulation. The results can be easily extended to the DINO model through the duality of the DINA and DINO models. Moreover, the proposed theoretical framework could be applied to study the identifiability issue of other DCMs.},

 abstract = {Cognitive diagnosis models (CDMs) are latent class models that hold great promise for providing diagnostic information about student knowledge profiles. The increasing use of computers in classrooms enhances the advantages of CDMs for more efficient diagnostic testing by using adaptive algorithms, referred to as cognitive diagnosis computerized adaptive testing (CD-CAT). When multiple-choice items are involved, CD-CAT can be further improved by using polytomous scoring (i.e., considering the specific options students choose), instead of dichotomous scoring (i.e., marking answers as either right or wrong). In this study, the authors propose and evaluate the performance of the Jensen-Shannon divergence (JSD) index as an item selection method for the multiple-choice deterministic inputs, noisy {\textquotedbl}and{\textquotedbl} gate (MC-DINA) model. Attribute classification accuracy and item usage are evaluated under different conditions of item quality and test termination rule. The proposed approach is compared with the random selection method and an approximate approach based on dichotomized responses. The results show that under the MC-DINA model, JSD improves the attribute classification accuracy significantly by considering the information from distractors, even with a very short test length. This result has important implications in practical classroom settings as it can allow for dramatically reduced testing times, thus resulting in more targeted learning opportunities.},

 abstract = {The higher-order structure and attribute hierarchical structure are two popular approaches to defining the latent attribute space in cognitive diagnosis models. However, to our knowledge, it is still impossible to integrate them to accommodate the higher-order latent trait and hierarchical attributes simultaneously. To address this issue, this article proposed a sequential higher-order latent structural model (LSM) by incorporating various hierarchical structures into a higher-order latent structure. The feasibility of the proposed higher-order LSM was examined using simulated data. Results indicated that, in conjunction with the deterministic-inputs, noisy {\textquotedbl}and{\textquotedbl} gate model, the sequential higher-order LSM produced considerable improvement in person classification accuracy compared with the conventional higher-order LSM, when a certain attribute hierarchy existed. An empirical example was presented as well to illustrate the application of the proposed LSM.},

@article{ZhengWang.2017,
 abstract = {Cognitive diagnosis has emerged as a new generation of testing theory for educational assessment after the item response theory (IRT). One distinct feature of cognitive diagnostic models (CDMs) is that they assume the latent trait to be discrete instead of continuous as in IRT. From this perspective, cognitive diagnosis bears a close resemblance to searching problems in computer science and, similarly, item selection problem in cognitive diagnostic computerized adaptive testing (CD-CAT) can be considered as a dynamic searching problem. Previously, item selection algorithms in CD-CAT were developed from information indices in information science and attempted to achieve a balance among several objectives by assigning different weights. As a result, they suffered from low efficiency from a tug-of-war competition among multiple goals in item selection and, at the same time, put an undue responsibility of assigning the weights for these goals by trial and error on users. Based on the searching problem perspective on CD-CAT, this article adapts the binary searching algorithm, one of the most well-known searching algorithms in searching problems, to item selection in CD-CAT. The two new methods, the stratified dynamic binary searching (SDBS) algorithm for fixed-length CD-CAT and the dynamic binary searching (DBS) algorithm for variable-length CD-CAT, can achieve multiple goals without any of the aforementioned issues. The simulation studies indicate their performances are comparable or superior to the previous methods.},
